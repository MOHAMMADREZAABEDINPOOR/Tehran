                        Hailing from the nation's capital, Washington D.C., Tehran was born and raised in the United States to an Iranian father and a Black-American mother. His parents chose the name Tehran as a reminder of his Persian roots and culture. The nickname "SoParvaz" - a more literal way of saying "So Fly" - was added much later. Speaking, reading, and writing Farsi, he has great respect for his Iranian heritage as well as his American side. Welcome, enjoy and know now and forever: <strong>I AM TEHRAN.</strong>

                        Tehran is definitely NO angel - in fact, he's very "sheytoon" (mischievous). Being in trouble and getting 
                        out of it is part of his charm. From going to school to going to court, Tehran talks openly about his life 
                        exploits and lessons on stage and TV, connecting with audiences of all walks of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Putting motivation and inspiration in his humor (or vice versa), Tehran encourages younger and older 
                        audiences alike to understand each other, respect each other, learn from each other, and teach each other. 
                        His comedy is real, relatable, and always from the heart.
